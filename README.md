# QMine

QMine is a Qt5/C++ 11 application. It is a client for a [MINE
server](http://github.com/Ezveus/Mine).

It uses MINE Protocol over TCP using QtNetwork.

A window allows the user to choose the address and the port of the server. Default is localhost:8080 (default MINE over TCP port).

It provides menus and emacs-style shortcuts beginning (for most of them) with C-d.
